{"name":"RenderQueue","type":"class","module":"Rendering","fields":[],"methods":[],"description":"A data structure for feeding sets of [Renderable] objects to the [RenderSystem].\n\nThe RenderQueue is divided into named semantic layers. Each layer is a queue of [Renderable]s that will be submitted to the [RenderSystem] for rendering. By default, a [Renderable] decides what layer it will go in based on its [Material].\n\nThey can also be rendered one layer at a time, which can be useful for various [Compositor] effects. For example, rendering everything in the scene except for the Lights layer, then rendering only the Lights layer to a different buffer, as in Deferred Shading."}
