{"name":"BaseApp","type":"class","module":"Application","fields":[],"methods":[],"description":"A base class for most game applications.\n\nBaseApp is mostly just a convenience class, in that you can initialize a [WebGLRenderSurface], [RenderSystem], [Scene], [Camera], and [Viewport] in your onRun callback, and this class will facilitate some common default behavior so you don't have to. Advanced users might choose not to extend BaseApp, and write their apps from scratch."}
