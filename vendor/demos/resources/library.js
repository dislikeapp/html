 * OmniEngine-JS is a full scale game engine implemented in Javascript using an object
 * oriented approach. The mission of the project is to provide as many triple-A features
 * as possible while keeping the application level code clean, neat, and easy to
 * understand, by taking care of the complex tasks of high performance rendering,
 * material composition, resource management and loading on-demand, game logic/mechanics,
 * physics, input, etc. under the hood, and keeping the underlying techniques abstracted
 * away from the game programmer.
